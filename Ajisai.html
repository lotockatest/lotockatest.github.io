        Hydrangeas are known for their large, globe-like flower clusters that change color based on
        soil acidity—blue in acidic soil, pink in alkaline soil, and purple in neutral soil. Hydrangeas
        thrive in Japan’s humid rainy season and can often be found in temple gardens and
        mountainous regions. Kamakura’s Meigetsu-in Temple and Hakone’s Hydrangea Train
        route are some of the most famous spots to see these flowers in full bloom.

        Traditionally, hydrangeas have been used to express regret or appreciation, making them a
        meaningful gift in situations where words might not be enough. Because of their changing
        colors, hydrangeas also symbolize change and transformation. In some contexts,
        hydrangeas can also symbolize betrayal, making them an unusual choice for love
        declarations.
