    <p>This site is dedicated to two Japanese flowers, with a main focus on the <a href="/Kiku.html">Kiku flower</a>, as that was the chosen page for this assignment.
    </p>
    <p>
        The selected page was chosen arbitrarily. The selected term for the assignment was "kiku flower" as it seems to have plenty of search results for the term, while still having the main page, <a href="/Kiku.html">Kiku.html</a>, show up in the search results consistently.
